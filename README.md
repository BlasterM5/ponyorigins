# Pony Origins

Origins replacement datapack mod, designed to compliment Mine Little Pony

This is a datapack mod, which replaces the origins in Origins with origins designed to work with the Mine Little Pony mod.

## Installation

Install Fabric (preferably using your favorite modloader)
Install Origins (and dependencies)
Install Mine Little Pony
Optional: Install HDSkins
Optional: Install Custom FoV (NOT Custom FOV, pay attention to the capitalization)
Install Pony Origins (insert jar into mods folder)
Start Minecraft
Optional: Set your player skin using Mine Little Pony or HDSkins
Optional: Go into Options, Accessibility, and set your FoV Effects to None, or "Vanilla Only" if you're using Custom FoV
Start Playing

## Uninstallation

If you need to remove this datapack from a world, simply run the command "ponyorigins:uninstall" immediately before you close the world or stop the server.
This will remove the scoreboard objectives used by ponyorigins from the world. Beware, reinstalling ponyorigins afterward may cause unexpected behavior with regards to advancements.

## Gameplay Basics

Welcome to the world of Mine Little Pony, a land of friendship and harmony. Many abilities work differently than they do in vanilla Origins.
